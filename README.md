     - Chili pepper
     - Onion
     - Sardine
     - Carrot
     - Green pepper

4. **Cook the Noodles**
   - Add the noodles to the seasoned boiling water.
   - Allow them to cook for approximately 5 minutes.

5. **Prepare the Egg**
   - Fry a mixed egg while the noodles cook.
   - Let the egg fry for about 2 minutes.

6. **Serve and Enjoy**
